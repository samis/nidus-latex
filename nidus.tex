\begin{abstract}
NiDuS is an implementation of a DNS-esque protocol for the Minecraft mod OpenComputers. This document is a specification, description and commentary on version 1.0 of this protocool. It does not discuss the actual implementation of the protocol (i.e NiDuS itself.)
\end{abstract}

\chapter{Preface}
There are one or two things that need to be taken care of before the actual main topic of this book can be discussed. Firstly, it should be noted there is as of writing, no functional implementation of the protocol described here - so it should be assumed everything is from a hypothetical but realistic perspective. Secondly, I advise that you obtain the latest version of this document - the date's on the front page. After all, who knows what changes may have occurred since publication. Finally, we have all the copyright and license stuff. As this is documentation for the NiDuS protocol, it comes under the MIT license of NiDuS. For your convenience, a copy of the MIT license is included in Appendix A.
